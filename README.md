🧠 Code Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Code Practice Repository**! This space serves as a collection of my coding exercises, experiments, and learning projects. It's a journey through various programming concepts, primarily using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

📂 Project Overview

1. 🎯 Number Guessing Game

Files**: `day1_0_guessing_game.py`, `day1_0_guessing_game.ipynb`
Description**: A classic game where the computer selects a random number, and the player attempts to guess it. Features input validation, attempt limits, and user feedback.

2. ➕ Sum Numbers

File**: `day1_1_sum_number.ipynb`
Description**: A simple program that takes user input to calculate the sum of numbers. Useful for understanding loops and input handling.

3. ⏱️ Calculate Average Time

File**: `day1_2_caculate_average_time.ipynb`
Description**: Calculates the average of time durations entered by the user. Demonstrates parsing and arithmetic operations on time data.

4. 📊 Bubble Diagram

File**: `bubble_diagram.ipynb`
Description**: Generates a bubble chart using `matplotlib`. Explores data visualization techniques and customization of plots.

🚀 Getting Started

To run these projects locally:

1. Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Williamyichang/code-practice.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd code-practice
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing necessary packages like `matplotlib`.*

5. Run the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks**:

   For `.py` files:

     ```bash
     python filename.py
     ```
   For `.ipynb` files:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

     Then open the desired notebook in the Jupyter interface.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python: Core programming language for all projects.
Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for combining code with visualizations and explanations.
Matplotlib**: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
